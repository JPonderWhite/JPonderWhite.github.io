### About Me

Hey I'm Ponder. I currently work at Lehigh University as the Assistant Lighting Coordinator of the Zoellner Arts Center. I am mostly an itenerate lighting tech, but I'm trying to learn some coding and pick up some other skills while I work for a place that gives a tuition credit. 

I am taking this class to learn more about how data and information is processed and communicated. I have a strong backing in how narratives are communicated, but no first hand experience in how data is processed and passed around. I'd like to fix that, and am always looking for ways to obtain new skills and information.
