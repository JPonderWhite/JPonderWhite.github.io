### About Me

Hey I'm Ponder. I currently work at Lehigh University as the Assistant Lighting Coordinator of the Zoellner Arts Center. I am mostly an itenerate lighting tech, but I am learning some coding, and trying to pick up some other skills while I can. 

I am taking this class to learn more about how data and information is processed and communicated. I have a strong backing in how narratives are communicated, but no first hand experience in how data is processed and passed around. I'd like to fix that, and am always looking for ways to obtain new skills and information.


## Lehigh Enrollment 2017
This is series of pie chart I made for my Data Storytelling class. They show undergraduate enrollment at the various colleges at Lehigh University, first by a gender breakdown, and then by total enrollment. They show that the College of Arts and Sciences is the largest, making up about 36% of Lehighs total enrollment. With the College of Engineering, and the College of Buisness being the next most populous in second and third place respectively.
