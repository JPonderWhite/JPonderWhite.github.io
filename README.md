## About Me

Hey I'm Ponder. I currently work at Lehigh University as the Assistant Lighting Coordinator of the Zoellner Arts Center. I am mostly an itenerate lighting tech, but I am learning some coding, and trying to pick up some other skills while I can. 

I am taking this class to learn more about how data and information is processed and communicated. I have a strong backing in how narratives are communicated, but no first hand experience in how data is processed and passed around. I'd like to fix that, and am always looking for ways to obtain new skills and information.


# US Federal Reserve Charts
I'm experimenting with how different charts affect impact of data presented. So here is a quick series of charts based off of the same data from the Federal Reserve. The first two will show overall trends. The first measuring total wealth (in USD trillions), the second chart will be in percent of total wealth. All will be measured by Income Percentile.

# Lehigh Enrollment 2017
This is series of pie chart I made for my Data Storytelling class. They show undergraduate enrollment at the various colleges at Lehigh University, first by a gender breakdown, and then by total enrollment. They show that the College of Arts and Sciences is the largest, with the College of Engineering, and the College of Buisness being the next most populous in second and third place respectively.

</script>


# Lehigh Enrollment 2011-2020
This line chart was also made for Data Storytelling. It tracks the enrollment over the past decade. One interesting note is that while 2017 saw the largest enrollment being in the College of Arts and Sciences, while this chart shows the College of Engineering being the most populous. I'm not quite sure what the disconnect is. My guess is either bad data, or a mismatch between counting grad students and not.
